### Lost Ark Check List 
This web app allows users to manage and track task completion for multiple characters in a game. Each character has a list of tasks (e.g., Guild Shop, Raids, Exchanges), and users can toggle the completion status of each task. The state of each characterâ€™s tasks is saved to localStorage, so the task completion state persists across page reloads. A button allows users to reset all tasks to "not completed" with a confirmation prompt.
